            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This restaurant database project showcases SQL queries used to analyze sales performance, menu insights, and customer ordering trends. The dataset consists of two key tables: order_details and menu_items, which are joined to extract meaningful business insights. Queries include identifying the most and least ordered menu items, calculating average dish prices by category, and determining the top revenue-generating orders. Additionally, the project explores menu composition by counting dishes in each category and analyzing price distributions. By leveraging SQL for data-driven decision-making, this project highlights how restaurants can optimize their menu offerings and improve customer experiences.</p>
