            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This Human Resources Dashboard made in Tableau provides an interactive overview of key HR metrics, including total active employees, hires, and terminations, along with workforce trends over time. It features demographic insights such as gender distribution, education levels, and age groups, while also analyzing employee performance and salary trends based on education and gender. Additionally, the dashboard highlights department-wise and location-based employee distribution, offering a clear view of workforce allocation. A detailed, filterable employee list allows users to explore job roles, salaries, hire dates, and employment statuses. Designed for HR teams, this dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making, optimizing workforce management and hiring strategies.</p>
        
            <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
            <p>This section explores deeper insights into the data presented in the HR dashboard. It highlights key HR metrics such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Employee Performance</strong>: How different departments and teams are performing based on various KPIs.</li>
                <li><strong>Turnover Rate</strong>: Breakdown of employee turnover by department, tenure, and reason for leaving.</li>
                <li><strong>Absenteeism</strong>: Tracking of employee absences and its impact on productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Engagement</strong>: Correlation between engagement scores and overall company performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, the dashboard revealed that employee performance in the IT department tends to be higher, while the marketing department has a higher turnover rate.</p>
        
            <h2>Data Insights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Workforce Demographics:</strong> The distribution of employees by age, gender, department, and tenure.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Performance:</strong> KPIs like productivity, goals achieved, and development progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention Rates:</strong> Analysis of the number of employees staying versus leaving, including reasons for turnover.</li>
                <li><strong>Absenteeism:</strong> Insights into the number of sick days and unplanned leave, highlighting departments with higher absenteeism.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Data from employee records, performance evaluations, and HRIS (Human Resource Information Systems) were gathered.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Inaccuracies, duplicates, and missing values were addressed using standard data cleaning practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Pivot tables were created to analyze performance, absenteeism, and turnover, with slicers for dynamic filtering.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Data visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps were used to highlight trends and insights.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Challenges Addressed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Difficulty Identifying Trends:</strong> Spotting long-term patterns in hires, exits, or salary progression is difficult in raw data. The dashboard visualizes trends over time, making them easier to detect and act on.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Drill-Down Capability:</strong> Executives may need more detail than high-level summaries offer. With filterable employee lists and role-specific data, the dashboard allows deeper dives for granular analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Visibility into Demographics:</strong> Understanding diversity and representation is critical—but not always easy. This dashboard provides clear breakdowns of gender, education, and age distributions to support DEI efforts.</li>
                <li><strong>Static Reporting:</strong>Traditional HR reports are static and require regeneration for updates. This dashboard is dynamic, filterable, and always current, enhancing decision-making with up-to-date info.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Data Integration:</strong> Integrating with live HR systems for real-time updates on employee performance, absences, and engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Adding predictive models to forecast turnover rates, identify high-risk employees, and recommend retention strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Visualizations:</strong> Implementing more sophisticated visualizations, such as geographic maps for workforce distribution and heatmaps for employee engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Feedback Integration:</strong> Including employee survey data to measure engagement and satisfaction, providing a holistic view of workforce health.</li>
            </ul>
